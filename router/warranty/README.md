# Limited Warranty


Open Internet (Delaware) Incorporated (“OpenInternet”) warrants that the hardware portion of a new Router will be free from material defects in workmanship and materials under normal use 1 year from the date of original retail purchase of the product. This Limited Warranty is only valid and enforceable in locations the Router is sold and will apply only if you purchased your Router from OpenInternet or its authorized resellers.


This Limited Warranty only applies to hardware components (and not any software elements) of the Router, and this Limited Warranty does not apply if:

the Router is damaged by Acts of God, power surge, misuse, negligence, accident, wear and tear, mishandling, misapplication or other causes unrelated to defects in the Router;
the Router is used for commercial purposes (including rental or lease);
the Router has been tampered with, the case has been opened, or assembly seal has been removed or damage;
the Router has been altered or modified, or the software has been manipulated;
the Router damage was caused by use with non-OpenInternet products;
the Router has not been installed, operated, repaired, or maintained in accordance with instructions supplied by OpenInternet;
the Router has been subjected to abnormal physical or electrical stress, misuse, negligence, or accident;
the Router is supplied or licensed for beta, evaluation, testing or demonstration purposes for which OpenInternet does not charge a purchase price or license fee; or
the product has been used with a power adapter other than that provided by OpenInternet if provided.
 

This Limited Warranty does not guarantee that use of the Router will be uninterrupted or error-free. The Limited Warranty is only applicable to the original purchaser of the product. Proof of purchase and a complete product serial number are required to receive any services guaranteed as part of the limited warranty. If this product fails to work as warranted above, the customer’s sole and exclusive remedy and OpenInternet’s sole liability shall be repair or replacement. OpenInternet’s maximum liability under this limited warranty is expressly limited to the lesser of the price you have paid for the product or the cost of repair or replacement of any hardware components that malfunction under normal use.

If proof of purchase can't be provided, a warranty period start date will be assigned by OpenInternet., all Router or part thereof that is replaced by OpenInternet, or for which the purchase price is refunded, shall become the property of OpenInternet upon replacement or refund.

 

# Limitation of Warranty Period

To the extent not prohibited by law, all implied warranties and conditions or merchantability, satisfactory quality or fitness for a particular purpose are limited to the duration of the warranty period. All other express or implied conditions, representations and warranties, including, but not limited to, any implied warranty or non-infringement, and disclaimed. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to you. This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Where any term of this Warranty is prohibited by such laws, it shall be null and void, but the remainder of the Warranty shall remain in full force and effect if its allocation of risks is not materially disturbed.  

 

# Limitation of Liability

To the extent not prohibited by law, in no event will OpenInternet be liable for any lost data, revenue or profit, or for special, indirect, consequential, incidental or punitive damages, regardless of the theory of liability (including negligence), arising out of or related to the use of or inability to use the product (including any software), even if OpenInternet has been advised of the possibility of such damages. The foregoing limitations will apply even if any warranty or remedy provided under this limited warranty fails of its essential purpose. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.

Some States do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
